## <a id="introduction"></a>📖 Introduction

**EvoMaster** is a lightweight yet powerful framework designed to enable researchers and developers to rapidly build their own scientific agents.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, applying them to complex scientific domains often requires intricate engineering—managing tools, skills, memory, and multi-agent coordination. EvoMaster bridges this gap. It provides a highly compatible and extensible infrastructure that abstracts away the complexity, allowing you to focus on the scientific problem at hand.

Whether you are building a chemist agent to plan synthesis paths or a biologist agent to analyze proteins, EvoMaster serves as the foundational infrastructure for the next generation of scientific discovery.

## <a id="key-features"></a>✨ Key Features

### 1. ♾️ Universal Compatibility

EvoMaster is built to play well with others. It supports and adapts to the mainstream technologies defining the current Agent landscape.

* **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Seamlessly manage interactions between multiple agents.
* **Tool Usage & Skills:** Native support for [MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) tool calling and dynamic [skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

### 2. ⚡ Rapid Development

Complexity shouldn't be a barrier to innovation. EvoMaster is designed for portability and ease of use.

* **Minimal Boilerplate:** Spin up a custom agent with **just ~100 lines of code**.
* **Modular Design:** Plug-and-play components allow for quick customization without rewriting core logic.

### 3. 🔬 The SciMaster Ecosystem

Don't start from scratch. EvoMaster grants you immediate access to state-of-the-art scientific agents and allows you to apply their architectures to new domains.

* **Out-of-the-box Access:** Quickly deploy agents from the **[SciMaster](https://scimaster.bohrium.com/chat/)** series.
* **Domain Adaptation:** Easily retarget successful SciMaster series agents from to other scientific fields such as Biology, Material Science, etc.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Use your API key
Open the config file at `configs/[playground name]` and fill in the corresponding blank. For example, if you want to run minimal_multi_agent with Deepseek-V3.2, open `configs/minimal_kaggle/deepseek-v3.2-example.yaml` and modify:
```bash
  local_sglang:
    provider: "deepseek"
    model: "deepseek-v3.2"
    api_key: "dummy"
    base_url: "http://192.168.2.110:18889/v1"
```
You can also use the `openai` config if your API supports OpenAI's format. Remember to modify the llm configuration of the following Agent at the same time

### Basic Usage

```bash
cd EvoMaster
python run.py --agent minimal --task "Your task description"
```

### With Custom Config

```bash
python run.py --agent minimal --config configs/minimal/config.yaml --task "Your task"
```

### From Task File

```bash
python run.py --agent minimal --task task.txt
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
python run.py --agent minimal --interactive
```

## 📋 Examples

### Single Agent (Minimal)
```bash
python run.py --agent minimal --config configs/minimal/deepseek-v3.2-example.yaml --task "Discover a pattern: Given sequence 1, 4, 9, 16, 25... find the formula"
```

### Multi-Agent System
```bash
python run.py --agent minimal_multi_agent --config configs/minimal_multi_agent/deepseek-v3.2-example.yaml --task "Write a Python program that implements the following features: Read a text file (create a sample file if it doesn't exist). Count the occurrences of each word in the file. Sort the results by frequency in descending order. Save the results to a new file named word_count.txt. Output the top 10 most common words to the terminal."
```

### X-Master Workflow
```bash
# install environment for example machine learning task
pip install -r playground/minimal_kaggle/requirements.txt
python run.py --agent x_master --task "Which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem do critical-level views violate?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Egalitarian Dominance\nB. General Non-Extreme Priority\nC. Non-Elitism\nD. Weak Non-Sadism\nE. Weak Quality Addition"
```

### Kaggle Automation
```bash
python run.py --agent minimal_kaggle --config configs/minimal_kaggle/deepseek-v3.2-example.yaml --task playground/minimal_kaggle/data/public/description.md
```

## 📦 Installation

### With pip

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sjtu-sai-agents/EvoMaster.git
cd EvoMaster

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure LLM API keys in configs/
```

### With uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package installer. Use either:

```bash
# Option 1: sync from pyproject.toml + uv.lock (recommended)
uv sync

# Option 2: install from requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a venv and run with uv: `uv venv && source .venv/Scripts/activate` (Windows) or `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS), then `uv sync`.
